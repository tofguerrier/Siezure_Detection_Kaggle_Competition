# Siezure_Detection_Kaggle_Competition

This is the CN Splinter Group (Barry Haycock, Christophe Guerrier,Paddy Collins and Deborah Carberry) submission for the AmericanEpilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge on Kaggle.com.We placed well.Details of the winning entry, a competitive conglomerate from adetected medical diagnostics company, are here:http://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction/forums/t/11024/our-solution/63237Their transforms are similar to our own, but also applied a uniquealgorithm to attempt to group datasets together- which allowed theMedial-Research team to really advance their predictive capabilities.Our entry represents the foundations of a very flexible framework thatcan be (and will be) repurposed to any number of similar ETL then applyprediction algorithm type work.There is extensive “quick-start” and developer documentation in thedocumentation folder. The modules are written such that they can beused as standalone programs, or imported directly into your iPythonNotebook / IDE / Interactive Python and can be immediately used forexploratory work.
